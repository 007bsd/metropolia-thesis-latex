\chapter*{Preface}

A Preface is optional but highly recommended. In this page you may use informal language 
such as “This study was a long and hard journey for me but it is done now … finally!”  
Remember that after this preface you are not allowed to use informal language and do not use “I” or “You” etc. 
in the coming sections (see below).

“I this thesis I studied …” should be something like “This thesis includes a study …”

A Preface, which is typically about half a page long, includes:
-	challenges you faced while writing the thesis
-	things you learned
-	acknowledgments for those who helped you to do your thesis (colleagues, instructor, family, friends, pets ….)
