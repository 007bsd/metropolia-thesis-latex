\chapter*{Preface}

Embarking on this thesis has been a long and hard journey.
Juggling work and study simultaneously was no easy feat, and
it often felt like a balancing act that required all my focus and energy.
Despite the late nights and the constant juggle between professional and
academic obligations, the sense of accomplishment I feel now makes it all
worthwhile.

I extend my deepest gratitude to my current employer for their support and
flexibility, which allowed me to pursue my studies while fulfilling my
professional responsibilities. I am thankful to my director, Parvez
Shaik, and my manager, Kari Lee, for their mentorship and encouragement. Their
belief in my abilities and the support from the entire team have been a source
of inspiration and motivation.

I also owe a big thank you to my professors and mentors. Professor Sami Sainio
deserves a special mention for his valuable advice on thesis writing and his
thorough reviews of my drafts. His suggestions have significantly improved my
work. I'm equally thankful to Professor Ville Jääskeläinen, who leads the IT
Master's program, and Dr. James Collins, for their guidance and support.

Last but not least, I must express my immense gratitude to my family for their
unwavering support throughout my entire academic journey.
