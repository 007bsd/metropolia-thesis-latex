\def\abstract{
System testing of any software product is very important to maintain good quality, security, and integrity.
Embedded systems which bind the software execution tightly between the hardware architecture and software in a tight
loop has grown at a steady pace over the years. As the embedded systems are complex, it is recommended to apply
software testing throughout the development process.

The manual, traditional and automated testing of these embedded systems often follow the same static approaches to
ncover any vulnerabilities. Fuzzing or fuzz testing is a dynamic automated testing technique which subjects a system to
a stream of input data by modifying the valid seeds to find bugs and vulnerabilities. Fuzzing has been used to exploit
any edge cases and to check the weakness after causing the system to fail.

This thesis explores the possibility of the adoption of fuzzing as a test method to support the embedded software
development lifecycles and improving the system testing and the coverage. The aim is to study different fuzzing
techniques, methods, and the tools available, and doing a case study to implement the best suitable one for the project.
For the implementation of the case study, we studied current state of the art fuzzing tools and techniques and the
classifications of different fuzzing approaches. Machine Learning + fuzzing and side channel aware
fuzzing were not scope of this thesis.

The output and results of the thesis are that fuzzing is a popular way to test the correctness and security of 
embedded systems and can be implemented for the improvement of the embedded system testing.
Found out that, the Fuzzing testing must be done continuously. It helps in findings bugs irrespective of the project
requirements and not a replacement to the functional testing but an additional.
