\def\abstract{
System testing of any software product is important to maintain quality, security, and
integrity. Embedded systems which bind the software execution between the hardware
architecture and software in a tight loop has grown at a steady pace over the years.
For any software development, it is recommended to apply software testing throughout the
development process.

The manual, traditional and automated testing of embedded systems often follow the same static
approaches to uncover any vulnerabilities. Fuzzing or fuzz testing is a dynamically automated
testing technique which subjects a system to a stream of input data by modifying the valid seeds.
Any program which accepts untrusted and malformed data is ideal for applying fuzzing. Fuzzing has
been used to exploit any edge cases by generating a huge number of input data. The errors are
not essentially related to functional requirements.

This thesis explores the possibility of the adoption of fuzzing in the embedded software development
lifecycles to discover faults. The aim is to do a literature review of different fuzzing
techniques, methods, success of fuzzing and the tools available. For the implementation, a proof of
concept will be created using the project ``OSS-Fuzz'' and clusterfuzzlite were chosen.

This thesis shows that fuzzing is a popular way to test the correctness and
security of embedded systems and that it can be implemented for the overall improvement in the
embedded system testing. The Fuzz testing must be deployed continuously to find the
vulnerabilities before the software gets shipped. Fuzzing helps in finding bugs irrespective of
the project requirements and is not a replacement to the functional testing, but a
necessary add-on.
