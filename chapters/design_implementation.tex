\chapter{Design, Implementations and Results}

This chapter details the methodology adopted for incorporating fuzzing into
sample targets known as \gls{fuzz_target} operating on the
Zephyr \gls{rtos}~\cite{Security75:online}. These targets were selected to demonstrate the
practical applicability of the research.

Various fuzzers have been discussed in preceding sections, but
AFL++~\cite{257204} and libFuzzer~\cite{libFuzze17:online} were selected for
demonstration because of their unique capabilities and widespread adoption.
These fuzzers underline the importance of the study, considering the widespread
use of real-time operating systems in contemporary embedded devices.

In addition to the \acrlong{poc} usage of AFL++~\cite{257204}, and libFuzzer~\cite{libFuzze17:online}, the
AFL++ in QEMU mode~\cite{AFLplusp57:online} was utilized to broaden the scope of
the study, enabling fuzz testing of closed-source binaries~\cite{nagy2021breaking} within the company's case.
This inclusion demonstrates the adaptability of the fuzzing methodology and its
practical applicability to a range of software types.

For the execution of fuzzing tests, a Linux environment was utilized, where
AFL++~\cite{257204}, AFL++ in QEMU mode~\cite{AFLplusp57:online} are used with Docker~\cite{anderson2015docker}~\cite{aflplusp99:online},
and libFuzzer\cite{libFuzze17:online} were pre-installed, and the Zephyr RTOS~\cite{Security75:online}
environment was configured.


\section{Implementations Using AFL++}
This section delineates the detailed steps for setting up the
AFL++~\cite{257204} fuzzer using a Docker~\cite{anderson2015docker}~\cite{aflplusp99:online}
container and compiling the target program.

The selection of the AFL++ Docker image~\cite{aflplusp99:online} as the basis for the initial setup was
driven by the recommendations provided by the AFL++ documentation~\cite{GitHubAF78:online}. This particular
image is endorsed due to its comprehensive inclusion of all necessary AFL++ tools,
consolidated in a singular location, thereby facilitating a streamlined
and efficient setup process~\cite{257204}.

Steps to start fuzzing with AFL++:

\subsection*{Step 1: Docker Script for AFL++}
\label{subsec:docker script for afl-fuzz}
The first step involves pulling the AFL++ Docker image and running a container:
\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
#!/bin/bash
# Pull the AFL++ Docker image
$ docker pull aflplusplus/aflplusplus
# Run a container using the pulled image
$ docker run -ti -v /home/uname:/home/uname --name afl_container aflplusplus/aflplusplus
# Get into the container
$ docker exec -it afl_container /bin/bash
\end{minted}

This script facilitates the deployment of the AFL++ fuzzer in a Docker container,
streamlining the setup process for fuzzing tests.

\subsection*{Step 2: List of Files}
The relevant files for the next step are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{main.c}: The target program
    in Appendix:~\ref{appx:first} in Listing~\ref{lst:main_program_afl}.
    \item \texttt{CMakeLists.txt}: Build configuration file
    in Appendix:~\ref{appx:first} in Listing~\ref{lst:cmake_list_txt_afl}..
\end{itemize}

The detailed implementation of the target program can be
found in Appendix:~\ref{appx:first} in Listing~\ref{lst:main_program_afl}. This program, written
in C, exemplifies the integration of fuzz testing for a sample application.

\subsection*{Explanation of the Main Program:}
The \texttt{main.c}~\ref{lst:main_program_afl} program serves as the target for the fuzz testing,
designed to illustrate potential vulnerabilities.
It's structured to simulate a scenario where specific inputs could trigger a
failure case, providing a practical example for the fuzzing tests conducted.

This particular program was selected due to its specific characteristics
essential for fuzz testing. Fuzz testing is coverage-based and requires hiding a
failure point— in this case, a write through a null pointer~\cite{spoto2011precise}—deep within the call
structure of the program. Such concealed failures can be challenging to reveal
with randomly-selected input, yet a fuzzer aims to uncover them in a relatively
linear time by systematically exploring each function~\cite{FuzzingE54:online0}\cite{linssen2020snpfuzz}.

Even in situations where the probability of discovering the failure is low,
such as \(1 \times 2^{56}\), which typically requires significant computational
time and resources, the fuzzer can detect the vulnerability in considerable time.

The program contains several key components:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{global\_null\_ptr}: A pointer that, under certain conditions,
can be triggered to write through a null, simulating a failure.
\item \textbf{key Array and found Array}: These arrays are used to check against
the input data, and keep track of discovered keys.
\item \textbf{GEN\_CHECK Macro}: This macro generates a series of check
functions that recursively call each other to simulate a deep call tree.
\end{itemize}

Upon execution, the program reads input data from a file. It then processes
this data through the series of check functions generated by
the \texttt{GEN\_CHECK} macro. If a match with the key array is found,
it simulates a failure by attempting a write through the \texttt{global\_null\_ptr}.
The failure case is hidden deep within the call tree, making it difficult to
discover through the random inputs but still discoverable through fuzz testing.

For a more detailed view of the \texttt{main.c} file, refer to
Appendix~\ref{appx:first} in Listing ~\ref{lst:main_program_afl}.

\textbf{Explanation of the CMakeLists.txt:}
The \texttt{CMakeLists.txt} in Appendix:~\ref{appx:first} in
Listing:~\ref{lst:cmake_list_txt_afl}, file is used for configuring the build system
of the \texttt{sample\_zephyr\_afl} project in the zephyr RTOS. Here is an
explanation of its components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{cmake\_minimum\_required(VERSION 3.20.0)}: This command
    specifies the minimum version of CMake that is required, which is version
    3.20.0 in this case.
    \item \texttt{project(sample\_zephyr\_afl)}: This command sets the name
    of the project to \texttt{sample\_zephyr\_afl}.
    \item \texttt{option(USE\_AFL "Use afl" OFF)}: This command declares an
    option named \texttt{USE\_AFL} that determines whether to use AFL. It is
    set to \texttt{OFF} by default.
    \item The conditional block \texttt{if(USE\_AFL)} checks
    whether \texttt{USE\_AFL} is turned on. If it is, the compiler is
    set to \texttt{afl-gcc-fast}~\cite{AFLplusp13:online}, and additional
    compiler flags for coverage are added. If \texttt{USE\_AFL} is turned off,
    the compiler is set to \texttt{gcc}~\cite{GCCtheGN9:online}.
    \item \texttt{add\_executable(zephyr\_aflfuzzer src/main.c)}: This
    command specifies that an executable named \texttt{zephyr\_aflfuzzer}
    should be created from the source file \texttt{src/main.c} in
    Listing:~\ref{lst:main_program_afl}.
\end{itemize}

For a more detailed view of the \texttt{CMakeLists.txt} file, refer to
Appendix:~\ref{appx:first} in
Listing:~\ref{lst:cmake_list_txt_afl}.

\subsection*{Step 3: Build and Compile}
A new directory, \texttt{build}, is created to contain all the build files.
The \texttt{cmake} command is invoked with the \texttt{-DUSE\_AFL=ON} option,
indicating that the build should be configured to
use \texttt{afl-gcc-fast}~\cite{AFLplusp13:online}.

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DUSE_AFL=ON ..
    $ make
\end{minted}

\subsection*{Step 4: Valid Input for the Target}
A binary file is created with a specific sequence of bytes.
This file will serve as the initial and valid input or corpus for the fuzzer,
allowing it to explore different code paths.

\begin{minted}{sh}
    $ echo -n -e '\x9e\x21\x0c\x18\x9d\xd1\x7e' > input_data/test_data.bin
\end{minted}

\subsection*{Step 5: Fuzz Testing with AFL++}
AFL++ is invoked with the \texttt{afl\-fuzz} command inside the docker container,
specifying the input directory containing the corpus \texttt{input\_data} and
the output directory \texttt{output}. The built binary \texttt{zephyr\_aflfuzzer}
is then executed with AFL++'s syntax for specifying input files.


\begin{minted}{sh}
    $ afl-fuzz -i input_data/ -o output/ -- ./sample_zephyr_afl/build/zephyr_aflfuzzer @@
\end{minted}

This section breaks down the components of this command~\cite{257204}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{afl-fuzz}: This is the command to initiate the AFL++ fuzzer.
    \item \texttt{-i input\_data/}: The \texttt{-i} flag specifies the
    input directory containing the `corpus' of sample input files,
    which serve as a basis to generate new test cases.
    \item \texttt{-o output/}: The \texttt{-o} flag denotes the output
    directory where AFL stores the results of the fuzzing session,
    including any crashes or hangs it discovers.
    \item \texttt{--}: This symbol denotes the end of the options passed
    to the AFL fuzzer. Any parameter listed after this is considered as
    an argument to the program being fuzzed, not as an option to AFL.
    \item \texttt{./sample\_zephyr\_afl/build/zephyr\_aflfuzzer}: This is the
    path to the target binary that will be fuzzed by AFL.
    \item \texttt{@@}: This placeholder is replaced by AFL with the name of a
    file containing the test case each time the target binary is run,
    allowing AFL to run the program with a multitude of different inputs
    without needing to modify the command line each time.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Step 6: Results, Analysis and Report}~\label{subsec:execution afl-fuzz}
The Figure:~\ref{fig:afl_execute_1} shows the AFL++ execution screen.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \AltText{Screenshot of the AFL++ Execution Screen displaying the fuzzer's runtime interface.
    Key elements include the status of the fuzzing process, such as cycle progress, paths discovered,
    and crash statistics. The screen reflects the dynamic nature of fuzzing with continuous
    updates on test cases and outcomes.}
    {\adjustbox{width=\textwidth}{\includegraphics{afl_execute_1}}}
    \caption{AFL++ Execution Screen}~\label{fig:afl_execute_1}
\end{figure}

Important elements of the user interface shown below~\cite{257204}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{process\_timing:} This section shows how long the fuzzer has
    been running and the current time.
    \item \textbf{stage progress:} Here, AFL++ displays the progress of the
    current fuzzing stage in terms of execution and the total number of inputs
    to be tested in this stage.
    \item \textbf{findings in depth:} This area provides details about the paths
    discovered, including the number of unique crashes, hangs, and paths found
    during the fuzzing session.
    % \item \textbf{fuzzing strategy yields:} This section gives insights into the
    % effectiveness of various fuzzing strategies by showing how many new paths, crashes, or hangs each strategy has yielded.
    \item \textbf{item geometry:} This displays information related to the paths
    taken through the program, such as the depth and width of the explored paths.
    %\item \textbf{pending favs:} It shows the number of favored paths (interesting inputs) that are yet to be processed.
    %\item \textbf{map coverage:} This section gives a snapshot of the code coverage, indicating the percentage of the target's codebase that has been executed by the inputs generated so far.
    %\item \textbf{speed:} This denotes the execution speed of the fuzzer, typically represented in executions per second.
    %\item \textbf{cycle progress:} This shows the progress of the current fuzzing cycle, indicating how much of the input corpus has been processed in this cycle.
    %\item \textbf{total execs:} This is a count of the total number of input cases that AFL++ has executed since the start of the fuzzing session.
    %\item \textbf{exec reliability:} This metric shows the reliability of the execution, highlighting if any executions were aborted.
    %\item \textbf{exec stability:} This indicates the stability of the target program during fuzzing, represented as a percentage.
    %\item \textbf{has\_new\_finds:} This field will be highlighted if AFL++ has found new, unique crashes or paths since the last UI update.
    %\item \textbf{has\_uniq\_finds:} This will be highlighted if AFL++ has found any new unique crashes, hangs, or paths since the last UI update.
    %\item \textbf{command:} At the bottom of the screen, the exact command-line used to start AFL++ is displayed.
\end{itemize}

As depicted in Figure:~\ref{fig:afl_execute_1}, the binary generated
(as detailed in Appendix:~\ref{appx:first}) resulted in AFL++ creating a total of
13 corpus and identifying one crash. Remarkably, a scenario with a
probability of \(1\) in \(2^{56}\), which would traditionally
require several months to years of computation in a large datacenter,
was resolved by the fuzzer in under two minutes~\cite{FuzzingE54:online}.

The resulting outputs are stored in the \textit{output} directory.
The coverage report of the execution can be generated using \textit{afl-cov}~\cite{GitHubmr91:online}.
The corresponding command is as follows:

\begin{minted}{sh}
    $ afl-cov -d output/ --coverage-cmd "./sample_zephyr_afl/build/zephyr_aflfuzzer @@" --code-dir ./sample_zephyr_afl/
\end{minted}

The Figure~\ref{fig:afl_cov} shows the \texttt{afl-cov} report of the execution.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \AltText{Screenshot of an LCOV Coverage Report showing the code coverage analysis.
    It includes statistics like the percentage of lines, functions, and branches covered,
    along with visual indicators such as color-coded line coverage highlighting the executed and
    non-executed parts of the code. The report provides a detailed overview of test coverage in
    various code modules.}
    {\adjustbox{width=\textwidth}{\includegraphics{afl_cov}}}
    \caption{LCOV Coverage Report~\cite{UbuntuMa97:online}}\label{fig:afl_cov}
\end{figure}

AFL++ includes a visualization tool called \texttt{afl-plot}~\cite{AFLFunct92:online},
which is instrumental in assessing the performance of fuzzing campaigns.
This tool generates a series of graphs that provide insights into several
crucial metrics throughout the fuzzing process. These metrics include,
but are not limited to, the number of crashes discovered,
the speed of execution, and the progression of path discovery over time.

\begin{minted}{sh}
    $ afl-plot output/default/ output/output_plot/
\end{minted}

The Figure:~\ref{fig:afl_plot} shows the \texttt{afl-plot} report of the execution.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \AltText{Graphical afl-plot Report illustrating the progress and results of a fuzzing session
    with AFL. The report includes plots showing the number of unique crashes and hangs over time,

    represent different metrics, highlighting trends and insights in the fuzzing process.}
    {\adjustbox{width=\textwidth}{\includegraphics{afl_plot}}}
    \caption{\texttt{afl-plot} Report}~\label{fig:afl_plot}
\end{figure}

The findings of this study reveal the
significant advantages of incorporating AFL++ into the development cycle,
emphasizing its potential to fortify system security.

\section{Implementations Using libFuzzer}
LibFuzzer~\cite{libFuzze17:online}, an integral part of the LLVM Compiler~\cite{libFuzze42:online} Infrastructure,
is chosen for this \acrlong{poc} due to its distinct attributes and capabilities.
LibFuzzer is renowned for its efficiency in performing coverage-guided fuzzing,
which is instrumental in identifying hidden vulnerabilities within a system~\cite{fuzzingt51:online}.

The fuzzer's seamless integration with the Clang compiler~\cite{ClangCLa81:online} and its capability
to perform in-memory fuzzing make it a valuable tool in assessing the security
and robustness of software systems.

Steps to start fuzzing with libFuzzer:

\subsection*{Step 1: Setting up Environment}
To set up the necessary environment, a Linux-based operating system,
specifically Ubuntu, is utilized. Furthermore, the installation of a recent
version of the Clang compiler is requisite for the successful execution of the
libFuzzer~\cite{ClangCLa81:online}.

\subsection*{Step 2: List of Files}
The relevant files for the next step are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{main.c}: The target program
    in Appendix:~\ref{appx:second} in
    Listing:~\ref{lst:main_program_libfuzzer}.
    \item \texttt{CMakeLists.txt}: Build configuration file.
    Refer to Appendix:~\ref{appx:second} in
    Listing:~\ref{lst:cmake_list_txt_libfuzzer}.
\end{itemize}

The detailed implementation of the target program can be
found in Appendix:~\ref{appx:second}.

Comparing this program in Appendix:~\ref{appx:second} in
Listing:~\ref{lst:main_program_libfuzzer} to the one utilized for
AFL++ in Appendix:~\ref{appx:first}, in
Listing:~\ref{lst:main_program_libfuzzer} there are fundamental differences that
can be highlighted:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Entry Point:} In the context of libFuzzer, the program uses a function
    named \texttt{LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput} as the entry point,
    which is specifically designed for integration with libFuzzer.
    This contrasts with the AFL++ target program, where the
    \texttt{main} function serves as the entry point.
    \item \textbf{Input Handling:} The libFuzzer target program directly uses
    the input data provided to the \texttt{LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput} function,
    representing a more straightforward handling of input compared to the
    AFL++ target program, which might necessitate additional steps for input
    retrieval and processing.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Explanation of the CMakeLists.txt:}
The \texttt{CMakeLists.txt} file is used for configuring the build system
of the \texttt{sample\_zephyr\_libFuzzer} project in the zephyr RTOS.
Here is an explanation of its components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{cmake\_minimum\_required(VERSION 3.20.0)}: Specifies the minimum required version of CMake to be 3.20.0.

    \item \texttt{project(sample\_zephyr\_libfuzzer)}: Names the project as \texttt{sample\_zephyr\_libfuzzer}.

    \item \texttt{option(USE\_LIBFUZZER "Build with libfuzzer" OFF)}: Declares an option \texttt{USE\_LIBFUZZER}, which is turned OFF by default but can be set to ON to enable building with libFuzzer.

    \item \texttt{set(CMAKE\_C\_COMPILER clang)}: Sets the C compiler for the project to Clang.

    \item \texttt{if(USE\_LIBFUZZER)}: Checks if \texttt{USE\_LIBFUZZER} is enabled.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{add\_definitions(-DUSE\_LIBFUZZER)}: Adds a definition for \texttt{USE\_LIBFUZZER} for the preprocessor.

        \item \texttt{set(CMAKE\_C\_FLAGS "... -fsanitize=fuzzer,address,undefined")}: Sets the compiler flags to enable sanitizers and fuzzer.

        \item \texttt{set(CMAKE\_EXE\_LINKER\_FLAGS "... -fsanitize=fuzzer,address,undefined")}: Sets the linker flags to enable sanitizers and fuzzer.

        \item \texttt{set(CMAKE\_C\_FLAGS "... -fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping")}: Enables flags for generating profile instrumentation and coverage mapping.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \texttt{add\_executable(zephyr\_libfuzzer src/main.c)}: Defines an executable target named \texttt{zephyr\_libfuzzer} from the source file \texttt{src/main.c}~\ref{lst:main_program_libfuzzer}.

    \item \texttt{if(USE\_LIBFUZZER)}: If \texttt{USE\_LIBFUZZER} is enabled, sets additional linker flags for the target \texttt{zephyr\_libfuzzer} to enable the necessary sanitizers for fuzzing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 3: Build and Compile}
A new directory, \texttt{build}, is created to contain all the build files.
The \texttt{cmake} command is invoked with the \texttt{-DUSE\_LIBFUZZER=ON} option,
indicating that the build should be configured to
use \texttt{clang}~\cite{ClangCLa81:online} with libFuzzer.

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build_fuzzer
    $ cmake -DUSE_LIBFUZZER=ON ..
    $ make
    $ ./zephyr_libfuzzer
\end{minted}

\subsection*{Step 4: Testing, Results and Analysis}
The `CMake' configuration for the \texttt{sample\_zephyr\_libfuzzer} project
provides a solid foundation for enabling fuzz testing with \texttt{libFuzzer}
and Clang's sanitizers~\cite{GitHubgo55:online}. The option to toggle the
\texttt{libFuzzer} integration is valuable, allowing the program to be compiled
with or without the fuzzing infrastructure. When the \texttt{USE\_LIBFUZZER}
option is activated, the system properly applies the necessary compiler and
linker flags to include \texttt{libFuzzer},
address sanitizer~\cite{GitHubgo55:online}, and
undefined behavior sanitizer~\cite{GitHubgo55:online}. Additionally,
the inclusion of instrumentation flags for profile generation and coverage
mapping indicates a commitment to not only identifying vulnerabilities but also
to measuring the coverage of the testing process. This dual focus on
vulnerability discovery and code execution coverage provides comprehensive
insight into the program's resilience against arbitrary and malicious inputs,
ultimately offering a valuable report on its security status.


The Figure:~\ref{fig:lib_fuzzer} shows the libFuzzer execution output.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \AltText{Screenshot of the libFuzzer Execution Screen, showing real-time fuzz testing output.
    The display includes information on the number of test cases executed, coverage statistics,
    and any detected bugs or crashes. Key metrics are highlighted, illustrating the ongoing process
    of fuzz testing and its immediate results.}
    {\adjustbox{width=\textwidth}{\includegraphics{lib_fuzzer}}}
    \caption{libFuzzer Execution Screen}~\label{fig:lib_fuzzer}
\end{figure}

Below code block shows that, the fuzzer initialized its execution with a specific random seed,
identified as 758034908~\ref{fig:lib_fuzzer}. To reproduce the same
sequence of fuzzing events and outcomes, one may rerun the fuzzer
specifying the argument \texttt{-seed=758034908}.

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
    INFO: Running with entropic power schedule (0xFF, 100).
    INFO: Seed: 758034908
    INFO: Loaded 1 modules   (157 inline 8-bit counters): 157 [0x555d997e79a8, 0x555d997e7a45),
    INFO: Loaded 1 PC tables (157 PCs): 157 [0x555d997e7a48,0x555d997e8418),
    INFO: -max_len is not provided; libFuzzer will not generate inputs larger than 4096 bytes
    INFO: A corpus is not provided, starting from an empty corpus
\end{minted}

The below code block from the libFuzzer execution shows that,
in its default configuration, \texttt{libFuzzer} operates under
the assumption that the input size is constrained to 4096 bytes or less.
To modify this default input size constraint, two potential strategies exist:
the application of the \texttt{-max\_len=N} argument, where \texttt{N} represents
the desired maximum input length, or the initiation of the fuzzer using a
seed corpus that contains non-empty entries. For this \acrlong{poc},
no corpus or input is provided, hence the libFuzzer starts with an empty corpus.

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}

\end{minted}

During its execution, \texttt{libFuzzer} has processed a minimum of
316,335(\#330709) distinct inputs. From these, it identified 17 unique
inputs with a combined size of 170 bytes (corpus: 17 entries totaling 170 bytes)
that cumulatively achieve coverage over 85 specific points within the target program.

Remarkably, for one particular input, the integrated \texttt{AddressSanitizer}~\cite{GitHubgo55:online}
identified an anomaly characterized as undefined behavior. Consequently, this prompted
the termination of the fuzzer's execution.

Before ending its process, \texttt{libFuzzer} saved the input causing the issue
to the disk. This action guarantees the ability to independently review the
specific conditions that resulted in the problem. Additionally,
it is important to note that the inputs causing crashes are stored in the same
directory to reproduce the issue. To reproduce the observed
behavior without additional fuzzing, execute the command with the input file
the causing the crash such as below:

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
./zephyr_libfuzzer crash-{the_input_that_cuased_the_crash_saved_in_the_disk}
\end{minted}

To show the profiling data, the following command utilizing \texttt{llvm-profdata} can be employed:

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
llvm-profdata merge -sparse default.profraw -o default.profdata
\end{minted}

This operation produces the files \texttt{default.profraw} and \texttt{default.profdata}, capturing the consolidated profiling information.

For a terminal-based summary of the coverage, the \texttt{llvm-cov} tool provides a report as follows:

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
llvm-cov report ./zephyr_libfuzzer -instr-profile=default.profdata
\end{minted}

Additionally, to create a more detailed visualization in HTML format, the
subsequent command can be used:

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
llvm-cov show ./zephyr_libfuzzer -instr-profile=default.profdata -format=html -output-dir=coverage
\end{minted}

This command generates an HTML report, which can be conveniently reviewed in a web browser,
providing an insightful representation of the code's coverage.

The Figure:~\ref{fig:llvm_cov_report} shows the libFuzzer coverage output in html format.

\section{Implementations Using AFL++ QEMU mode}

When conducting vulnerability analyses on closed-source binaries, the
AFL++'s QEMU~\cite{AFLplusp57:online} mode proves invaluable. In the absence of
source code, recompilation to create an instrumented binary is not possible.
AFL++-QEMU~\cite{AFLplusp57:online} addresses this issue through
a specialized version of QEMU's User Mode Emulation~\cite{bellard2005qemu},
facilitating the execution of the original binary while concurrently gathering essential coverage data.
This enhances the efficacy of identifying vulnerabilities within closed-source
binaries.

Steps to start fuzzing with AFL++-QEMU Mode:

\subsection*{Step 1: Identify the Fuzz Target}

The target binary accepts inputs from the host, parses it, and then sends the
data to the application. Given that the binary is closed-source,
the method of instrumentation is unknown.

The Figure:~\ref{fig:simplified_closed_binaries} shows the workflow with the target binary
for the fuzzy testing with AFL++'s QEMU~\cite{AFLplusp57:online} mode.

    \caption{Closed Source Target Binary}\label{fig:simplified_closed_binaries}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Step 2: Create Test data}
Generate the initial test data for fuzzing. The test comprises files that
contain various data types. Execute the following command to generate the files:

\begin{minted}[linenos, frame=lines, baselinestretch=1.2, breaklines]{sh}
mkdir input
python3 generate_files.py
\end{minted}

Refer to Appendix:~\ref{appx:third} in Listing~\ref{lst:python_code_qemu} for the script.

\subsection*{Step 3: Docker Script for AFL++-QEMU}
This step is same as that of the~\ref{subsec:docker script for afl-fuzz}.

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
#!/bin/bash
# Pull the AFL++ Docker image
$ docker pull aflplusplus/aflplusplus
# Run a container using the pulled image
$ docker run -ti -v /home/uname:/home/uname --name afl_container aflplusplus/aflplusplus
# Get into the container
$ docker exec -it afl_container /bin/bash
\end{minted}

\subsection*{Step 5: Fuzzing with AFLL++-QEMU mode, Results, And Analysis}
From the container execute the the below command with
QEMU mode (\begin{math}-Q\end{math} flag)

\begin{minted}{sh}
    $ afl-fuzz -i input/ -o output -Q -- /target_binary param1 param2 @@
\end{minted}

\begin{math}-Q\end{math} flag enables QEMU mode.
\textit{param1} and \textit{param2} are parameters that the target binary requires to run.
They are passed as command-line arguments to the target binary.

The Figure:~\ref{fig:simplified_closed_binaries_qemu} shows the basic
AFL++'s QEMU mode execution.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \AltText{Diagram showing the integration of AFL++-QEMU mode of the closed source binary}
    {\adjustbox{width=\textwidth}{\includegraphics{simplified_closed_binaries_qemu}}}
    \caption{Basic AFL++-QEMU Execution }\label{fig:simplified_closed_binaries_qemu}
\end{figure}

The explanation of the execution screen is same that of the~\ref{subsec:execution afl-fuzz}.

The Figure:~\ref{fig:afl_execute_qemu} shows the AFL++-QEMU execution screen.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \AltText{Screenshot of the AFL++-QEMU mode Execution Screen, showing the fuzzer's real-time
    interface while operating in QEMU mode. The display includes live statistics such as the number
    of executions per second, paths discovered, crashes found, and unique bugs identified. The interface
    illustrates the active fuzzing process and its immediate results in a terminal view.}
    {\adjustbox{width=\textwidth}{\includegraphics{afl_execute_qemu}}}
    \caption{AFL++-QEMU mode Execution Screen}\label{fig:afl_execute_qemu}
\end{figure}


From the execution screen, it was observed that after running the fuzzing
process for 11 minutes, it was forcefully stopped due to receiving 155 timeouts.
There were no crashes, but two hangs were recorded. The inputs causing these
hangs have been saved in the `output/default/hangs/' directory for further
analysis.

While the fuzzer running, `afl-whatsup' is used to show the status.

\begin{minted}{sh}
    $ afl-whatsup -s output
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}[linenos,frame=lines,baselinestretch=1.2,breaklines]{sh}
    Summary stats
    =============
           Fuzzers alive : 1
          Total run time : 11 minutes, 1 seconds
             Total execs : 18 thousands
        Cumulative speed : 27 execs/sec
           Average speed : 27 execs/sec
           Pending items : 0 faves, 0 total
           Crashes saved : 0
    Cycles without finds : 1
      Time without finds : 8 minutes, 23 seconds
\end{minted}

Upon further analysis, the files saved in `output/default/hangs/' were executed
manually against the target binary, but no hangs were observed. This indicates
that there might be a need for additional debugging in both the `afl-fuzz' tool
and the target binary.
