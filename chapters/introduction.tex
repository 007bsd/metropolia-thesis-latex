% Introduction

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:sec_introduction}
Embedded systems are specialized computer systems designed to perform specific tasks or functions
within a larger system~\cite{muench2018you}. They are integral to a wide variety of devices and
applications, enabling seamless functionality and efficiency in our daily lives. These systems
tightly integrate hardware and software components to optimize performance, power consumption,
and system size~\cite{eisele2022embedded}. The importance of embedded systems lies in their
ubiquity and versatility. They are found in numerous devices and industries, including consumer
electronics~\cite{andrae2010life}, telecommunications~\cite{paulin1995dsp},
automotive~\cite{Automoti68:online}, aerospace~\cite{bieber2012security},
medical~\cite{jafari2007medical}, and industrial automation~\cite{thramboulidis2007soa}.
Examples of embedded systems include microcontrollers~\cite{gridling2007introduction} in
smart home appliances~\cite{kang2017enhanced}, digital signal processors in wireless
communication devices~\cite{kostic1997digital}, control systems in autonomous
vehicles~\cite{kostic1997digital}, and sensor networks for monitoring and
automation~\cite{marwedel2021embedded}.


As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and reliant on technology,
the role of embedded systems continues to expand. They are essential for
enabling the \gls{iot}, as well as advancements in artificial intelligence,
robotics, medical instruments, and smart cities~\cite{camposano1996embedded:ARTICLE}.
As of February 2023, an estimated 21.5 billion interconnected devices
exist worldwide, according to Statista~\cite{IoTconne16:online}~\cite{HowManyI1:online}.
This number is expected to continue increasing as internet consumption rises, and
new gadgets and machinery are introduced to the market. By 2025,
it is projected that 75.44 billion \acrshort{iot} devices will be
installed worldwide~\cite{HowManyI1:online}.

The number of embedded devices per person is significantly higher in developed
countries than in developing nations. For example, in the United States, there
were approximately 13 \acrshort{iot} devices per person in 2020~\cite{Stateoft48:online}.
In comparison, the global average was around 3.5 \acrshort{iot} devices per person during
the same year~\cite{CiscoAnn1:online}. In developed countries, prevalent devices
typically include intelligent home appliances~\cite{wang2015anycontrol},
wearable technology~\cite{poongodi2020wearable}, and
interconnected vehicles~\cite{priyan2019survey}~\cite{Internet36:online}.
Conversely, in developing countries, there is a notable focus on deploying
devices that support key sectors such as
agriculture~\cite{baranwal2016development}, healthcare~\cite{pradhan2021iot},
and the monitoring of critical infrastructure~\cite{patil2012internet}.


The exponential growth of embedded systems necessitates robust security,
reliability, and efficiency measures to ensure the safety and functionality of
the technology we rely on daily~\cite{muench2018you}. Mirai malware attacks have
demonstrated their potential for large-scale disruption, targeting devices like
routers, cameras, and DVRs to execute \gls{ddos} attacks~\cite{KrebsOnS42:online}~\cite{antonakakis2017understanding}.
In 2016, a \acrshort{ddos} attack on Dyn~\cite{LargeDDo94:online}, a DNS provider, significantly
hindered user access to prominent services such as Twitter, Amazon, Tumblr, Reddit, Spotify, and
Netflix~\cite{muench2018you}~\cite{lindqvist2017future}. \textit{Ripple20},
a set of 19 critical vulnerabilities in the Treck TCP/IP library~\cite{TreckTCP63:online},
impacted IoT devices used in industrial control systems, healthcare devices,
and home appliances. The vulnerabilities known as URGENT/11~\cite{WhatisUR60:online}
and BadAlloc~\cite{IoTriddl27:online}, identified in the VxWorks
\gls{rtos}~\cite{VxWorksI53:online}, have impacted millions of embedded devices.
These devices range from medical equipment and industrial control systems to
routers~\cite{seri2019critical}. Stemming from flaws in memory allocation
functions, these vulnerabilities could enable remote code execution, thus
permitting attackers to gain control over the affected
devices~\cite{1NewMess42:online}.

As data breaches have become a prevalent issue in the digital age,
impacting individuals, businesses, and even governments~\cite{10oftheB31:online},
the following Table:~\ref{tab:data_breaches} highlights some of the most
significant data breaches that have occurred in
the 21st century~\cite{The15big77:online}~\cite{10oftheB31:online}.
These incidents serve as a reminder of the importance of robust
cybersecurity measures and the ongoing need for vigilance in
protecting sensitive information.

Software testing~\cite{myers2011art} is a crucial process in the development of embedded systems,
especially as the number of embedded and software-controlled devices continues
to increase. With this expansion, there is a growing potential for
illicit activities~\cite{broekman2003testing}. To mitigate the risks associated with these devices,
it is essential to enhance the quality and security of the produced software.
While traditional testing methods, such as manual~\cite{itkonen2009testers} and automated testing~\cite{asfaw2015benefits},
have been widely adopted, they have limitations in identifying all potential
vulnerabilities and edge cases, especially in terms of software security~\cite{819971}.

The \gls{Edge Cases} refer to scenarios or inputs that are at or beyond the outer limits or boundaries
of what is considered normal or typical. These edge cases explore the software's behavior when
it encounters extreme or uncommon conditions. By testing software with edge cases, including
inputs near the upper and lower limits, unusual values, or unexpected scenarios, developers
can identify potential issues or unexpected behaviors that may not be evident
during regular testing~\cite{deng2023large}~\cite{cunningham2019software}~\cite{koopman2016challenges}.

Fuzz testing, also known as fuzzing, is a dynamic testing technique that feeds random data into a
program and monitors the results~\cite{felderer2016security}\cite{yun2022fuzzing}.
Fuzz testing involves in generating input data variations based on valid inputs.
This process enables the exploration of edge cases and the detection of bugs that are not directly
related to
functional requirements~\cite{eisele2022debugger}~\cite{fowler2018fuzz}~\cite{deng2023large}~\cite{eisele2022embedded}.

Despite its success in general software testing, fuzz testing has not been widely adopted by
companies as part of their development lifecycle\cite{liang2018fuzz}.

This study embarks on a journey to examine the potential benefits and implications
associated with the incorporation of fuzz testing techniques into the development
lifecycle of a specific case company. Operating in the semiconductor sector,
this company specializes in embedded software development. Although it currently
utilizes traditional testing methods, such as manual and automated testing, it
has yet to explore and adopt fuzz testing within its development processes.
This gap in testing practices, amidst rising cyber threats, fuels the motivation
for this study.

This study aims to explore the potential benefits and implications of introducing
fuzz testing into the company's development lifecycle. The pivotal research
question is: ``Can the implementation of fuzz testing techniques significantly
strengthen the security and quality of embedded systems developed by the case
company?'' The importance of this question is notable given the
role of the company's systems across numerous critical applications and industries.

To address the research question, this study will initiate with a thorough
literature review on fuzz testing, encompassing its methodologies, applications,
and a range of tools utilized in the industry. Following the literature review,
a \gls{csa} of the company's existing software
testing practices will be conducted. This \acrshort{csa} aims to provide a
understanding of the current state of software testing within the
organization, identifying key areas where the adoption of fuzz testing could be
particularly advantageous. The analysis will explore the compatibility of
various fuzz testing tools with the company's software development lifecycle,
aiming to integrate the most effective practices to enhance the overall security
posture.

Following the \gls{csa}, the research will advance to a proof-of-concept case
study, employing widely-used fuzz testing tools such as AFL++~\cite{257204},
LibFuzzer~\cite{libFuzze17:online}, and the QEMU mode of AFL++~\cite{AFLplusp57:online}.
This exercise aims to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of fuzz testing
within the company's specific development environment.

The ultimate objective of this study is to highlight the potential benefits of
integrating fuzz testing into the embedded software development lifecycle, thus
providing valuable insights and a clear strategy for how fuzz testing can be
employed to enhance software quality and security. This study strives to serve as
a practical guideline for the case company, equipping them with actionable
insights for incorporating fuzz testing into their software development process.

enables early error detection, efficient location of issues, and
ultimately enhances testing efficiency~\cite{DevOpsin19:online}.

In the evolving landscape of automated security testing, fuzzing has
gained substantial attention for its potential. With this in mind,
the company is evaluating various fuzzing tools and techniques for its
embedded products. The objective of this evaluation is to investigate the
potential enhancements in the quality and coverage of their existing
testing processes.

\section{Objectives, Purpose, and Scope}

In the context of the rapidly growing technology landscape, the importance of
robust and efficient software testing methods cannot be overstated.
Embedded systems, being integral to countless applications and industries,
demand thorough testing to ensure their reliability, functionality, and most
importantly, security. Traditional software testing methods, while effective to
an extent, may not be sufficient to uncover all vulnerabilities in these
complex systems. Therein lies the necessity for advanced testing techniques
such as fuzz testing, which are designed to thoroughly probe software and uncover
issues that could potentially be exploited, leading to system breakdowns or breaches.

Fuzz testing, or fuzzing, has demonstrated its potential in enhancing software
quality and security, garnering significant interest
in the field of software testing. Despite this interest, its application, particularly in
embedded systems, remains somewhat limited due to a general lack of
understanding and awareness of the technique~\cite{liang2018fuzz}.
