\chapter{Introduction}

Embedded systems are growing rapidly and becoming really important component of modern life. From
workstations, microprocessors, servers to different consumer electronics devices including
cell phones, interconnected IoT devices, medical instruments, autonomous and connected vehicles
and many more, where the embedded systems can be found\cite{camposano1996embedded:ARTICLE}. But, in
reality it is impossible to know the correct number of IoT devices. In a recent study
shows\cite{IoTconne16:online} that the number of such devices are estimated to grow more than 29
billion devices by the year 2030 due to the rapid rise in day-to-day use. Due to this growth, the
security vulnerabilities are also increasing. The recent Mirai malware attacks, third party remote
exploitation on the automobile, and security attacks on the ICS are such examples\cite{muench2018you}.



According to \citeauthor{9787842}, due to the closed nature, complexity and high diversity of the
embedded system, fuzzing is not widely used.
