\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:sec_introduction}
Embedded systems are specialized computer systems that are designed to perform
specific tasks or functions within a larger system\cite{muench2018you}.They are
integral to a wide variety of devices and applications, enabling seamless
functionality and efficiency in our daily lives. These systems tightly
integrate hardware and software components to optimize performance, power
consumption, and system size\cite{eisele2022embedded}. The importance of
embedded systems lies in their ubiquity and versatility. They can be found in
numerous devices and industries, including consumer electronics\cite{andrae2010life},
telecommunications\cite{paulin1995dsp}, automotive\cite{Automoti68:online},
aerospace\cite{bieber2012security}, medical\cite{jafari2007medical}, and industrial
automation\cite{thramboulidis2007soa}. Examples of embedded systems include
microcontrollers\cite{gridling2007introduction} in smart home appliances\cite{kang2017enhanced},
digital signal processors in wireless communication devices\cite{kostic1997digital},
control systems in autonomous vehicles\cite{kostic1997digital}, and sensor
networks for monitoring and automation\cite{marwedel2021embedded}.

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and reliant on technology,
the role of embedded systems continues to expand. They are essential for
enabling the \gls{iot}, as well as advancements in artificial intelligence,
robotics, medical instruments, and smart cities\cite{camposano1996embedded:ARTICLE}.
As of February 2023, there are an estimated 21.5 billion interconnected devices
in the world, according to Statistas\cite{IoTconne16:online}\cite{HowManyI1:online}.
This number is expected to continue to increase as internet consumption rises and
new gadgets and machinery are introduced to the market and by 2025,
it is projected that 75.44 billion \acrshort{iot} devices will be
installed worldwide\cite{HowManyI1:online}.

The number of embedded devices per person is significantly higher in developed
countries than in developing nations. For example, in the United States, there
were approximately 13 \acrshort{iot} devices per person in 2020\cite{Stateoft48:online}.
In comparison, the global average was around 3.5 \acrshort{iot} devices per person during
the same year\cite{CiscoAnn1:online}. In developed countries, prevalent devices
typically include intelligent home appliances\cite{wang2015anycontrol},
wearable technology\cite{poongodi2020wearable}, and
interconnected vehicles\cite{priyan2019survey}\cite{Internet36:online}.
Whereas, a greater concentration of devices aimed at supporting agriculture\cite{baranwal2016development},
healthcare\cite{pradhan2021iot}, and monitoring critical infrastructure in developing countries\cite{patil2012internet}.

The exponential growth of embedded systems necessitates robust security,
reliability, and efficiency measures to ensure the safety and functionality of
the technology we rely on daily\cite{muench2018you}. Mirai malware attacks have
demonstrated their potential for large-scale disruption, targeting devices like
routers, cameras, and DVRs to execute \gls{ddos} attacks\cite{KrebsOnS42:online}\cite{antonakakis2017understanding}.
In 2016, a \acrshort{ddos} attack on Dyn\cite{LargeDDo94:online}, a DNS provider, significantly
hindered user access to prominent services such as Twitter, Amazon, Tumblr, Reddit, Spotify, and
Netflix\cite{muench2018you}\cite{lindqvist2017future}. \textit{Ripple20},
a set of 19 critical vulnerabilities in Treck TCP/IP library\cite{TreckTCP63:online},
impacted IoT devices used in industrial control systems, healthcare devices,
and home appliances. URGENT/11\cite{WhatisUR60:online} and BadAlloc\cite{IoTriddl27:online},
discovered in the VxWorks \gls{rtos}\cite{VxWorksI53:online},
affected millions of embedded devices, including medical devices, industrial control systems,
and routers\cite{seri2019critical}. These vulnerabilities originate from memory
allocation functions and can lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers
to seize control of compromised devices\cite{1NewMess42:online}.

As the data breaches have become a prevalent issue in the digital age,
impacting individuals, businesses, and even governments\cite{10oftheB31:online}.
The following table:\ref{tab:data_breaches} highlights some of the most
significant data breaches that have occurred in
the 21st century\cite{The15big77:online}\cite{10oftheB31:online}.
These incidents serve as a reminder of the importance of robust
cybersecurity measures and the ongoing need for vigilance in
protecting sensitive information.

Software testing\cite{myers2011art} is a critical process in the development of embedded systems,
especially as the number of embedded and software-controlled devices continues
to increase. With this expansion comes a growing potential platform for
illicit activities\cite{broekman2003testing}. To mitigate the risks associated with these devices,
it is imperative to improve the quality and security of the software produced.
While traditional testing methods, such as manual\cite{itkonen2009testers} and automated testing\cite{asfaw2015benefits},
have been widely used, they have limitations in uncovering all potential
vulnerabilities and edge cases, particularly in the context of software security\cite{819971}.

The \gls{edge-cases} refer to scenarios or inputs that are at or beyond the outer limits or boundaries
of what is considered normal or typical. These edge cases explore the software's behavior when
it encounters extreme or uncommon conditions. By testing software with edge cases, including
inputs near the upper and lower limits, unusual values, or unexpected scenarios, developers
can uncover potential issues or unexpected behaviors that may not be evident
during regular testing\cite{deng2023large}\cite{cunningham2019software}\cite{koopman2016challenges}.


Fuzz testing, also known as fuzzing involves dynamically generating input data variations
based on valid inputs, enabling the exploration of edge cases and the detection of bugs that are not directly
related to functional requirements\cite{9787842}\cite{fowler2018fuzz}\cite{deng2023large}\cite{eisele2022embedded}.
A dynamic testing technique which feeds the random data to a program till it crashes\cite{felderer2016security}\cite{yun2022fuzzing}.
Despite its success in general software testing, fuzz testing has not been implemented in the case
in company as part of their development lifecycle.

This study embarks on a journey to examine the potential benefits and implications
associated with the incorporation of fuzz testing techniques into the development
lifecycle of a specific case company. Operating in the semiconductor sector,
this company specializes in embedded software development. Although it currently
utilizes traditional testing methods, such as manual and automated testing, it
has yet to explore and adopt fuzz testing within its development processes.
This gap in testing practices, amidst rising cyber threats, fuels the motivation
for this study.

This study aims to explore the potential benefits and implications of introducing
fuzz testing into this company's development lifecycle. The pivotal research
question is: ``Can the implementation of fuzz testing techniques significantly
strengthen the security and quality of embedded systems developed by the case
company?'' The importance of this question cannot be overstated given the
role of the company's systems across numerous critical applications and industries.

To answer this research question, the study will begin with a \gls{csa} of
the company's existing software testing practices. This \acrshort{csa} will provide a
comprehensive understanding of the current testing environment and highlight
potential areas that could benefit from fuzz testing.

Upon completion of the \acrshort{csa}, the study will proceed to a proof-of-concept case
study using popular fuzz testing tools AFL++\cite{257204} and
LibFuzzer\cite{libFuzze17:online}.
This step will assess the effectiveness and feasibility of fuzz testing within
the company's specific development environment.

The ultimate objective of this study is to underline the potential benefits of
integrating fuzz testing into the embedded software development lifecycle, thus
providing valuable insights and a clear strategy for how fuzz testing can be
utilized to enhance software quality and security. This study aims to serve as
a practical guideline for the case company and equip them with actionable
insights for incorporating fuzz testing into their software development process.

\section{Objectives, Purpose and Scope}

In the context of the rapidly growing technology landscape, the importance of
robust and efficient software testing methods cannot be overstated.
Embedded systems, being integral to countless applications and industries,
demand meticulous testing to ensure their reliability, functionality, and most
importantly, security. Traditional software testing methods, while effective to
an extent, may not be sufficient to uncover all vulnerabilities in these
complex systems. Therein lies the necessity for advanced testing techniques
such as fuzz testing, which are designed to thoroughly probe software and uncover
issues that could potentially be exploited, leading to system breakdowns or breaches.

Fuzz testing, or fuzzing, has shown remarkable potential in enhancing software
quality and security, and as a result, it has garnered significant interest
